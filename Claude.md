# CLAUDE.md  
**Colaberry Agent Project Rules, QA Model & Operating Contract**

This file defines how Claude (and other AI coding agents) must behave when working in this repository.

This project does **not** use Moltbot.  
Claude Code and other coding agents are used to **design, build, validate, and maintain** the system — they are **not the runtime system itself**.

---

## Core Principle

LLMs are probabilistic.  
Production systems must be deterministic.

Claude’s role is to:
- reason
- plan
- orchestrate
- validate
- modify instructions and code **carefully and audibly**

Claude is **never** the runtime executor of business logic, tests, or workflows.

---

## High-Level Architecture

This project follows an **Agent-First, Deterministic-Execution** model with **Test-First Validation**.

---

## System Layers

### Layer 1 — Directives (What to do)
- Human-readable SOPs
- Stored in `/directives`
- Written in plain language
- Describe:
  - goals
  - inputs
  - outputs
  - edge cases
  - safety constraints
  - verification expectations

Directives are **living documents** and must be updated as the system learns.

---

### Layer 2 — Orchestration (Decision making)
- This is **Claude**
- Responsibilities:
  - read relevant directives
  - plan changes
  - design tests before logic
  - decide which tools, scripts, and tests are required
  - ask clarifying questions when intent is ambiguous
  - update directives with learnings

Claude **never** executes business logic or tests directly.

---

### Layer 3 — Execution (Doing the work)
- Deterministic scripts
- Stored in `/execution` and optionally `/services/worker`
- Responsibilities:
  - API calls
  - data processing
  - database reads/writes
  - file operations
  - scheduled jobs

Execution code must be:
- repeatable
- testable
- auditable
- safe to rerun

---

### Layer 4 — Verification (Proving it works)
- Stored in `/tests`
- Includes:
  - unit tests
  - integration tests
  - end-to-end tests
  - UI and workflow validation
- Tests are **first-class citizens**, not afterthoughts

Claude designs tests; tools execute them.

---

## Folder Responsibilities

Claude must respect the following boundaries.

### `/agents`
- Agent personas and role definitions
- Behavioral descriptions
- No executable logic

---

### `/directives`
- SOPs and runbooks
- Step-by-step instructions
- Human-readable
- Must define *how success is verified*

---

### `/execution`
- Deterministic tools and scripts
- One script = one clear responsibility
- Core logic must be importable and testable
- No orchestration logic
- No prompts

---

### `/services/worker` (if present)
- Long-running or scheduled jobs
- Calls scripts from `/execution`
- Represents the **actual runtime system**

---

### `/tests`
- Automated verification layer
- Mirrors execution and worker structure
- May include:
  - unit tests
  - integration tests
  - Playwright / browser-based tests
  - API contract tests
  - visual regression tests

---

### `/config`
- Environment wiring (dev vs prod identifiers)
- No secrets

---

### `/tmp`
- Scratch space
- Always safe to delete
- Never committed

---

## Testing & Validation Rules (Non-Negotiable)

Testing is **mandatory** and **gated**.

---

### Unit Testing
- All non-trivial execution logic must have unit tests
- Pure logic tested without I/O
- External dependencies mocked
- Tests must:
  - be fast
  - be deterministic
  - run locally

---

### Integration Testing
- May touch:
  - dev sandboxes
  - test databases
  - mock APIs
- Must:
  - never touch production
  - require explicit opt-in (env flag or CI label)

---

### End-to-End & UI Testing
- Used to validate:
  - routing
  - links
  - forms
  - auth flows
  - permissions
  - UI state
- Browser automation tools (e.g., Playwright) are preferred
- Claude may:
  - generate crawl tests
  - define form test matrices
  - design visual regression rules
- Claude must **not** manually simulate UI behavior in prose

---

### Worker Testing
- Workers are tested as routing logic:
  - correct script selection
  - retry behavior
  - idempotency
  - error handling
- Workers must never send real communications during tests

---

### Directive Validation
Directives are validated for:
- required sections
- referenced files/scripts existence
- markdown integrity
- clarity for junior developers

---

## Claude Operating Rules

### 1. Never act blindly
- Always read relevant directives first
- If none exist, ask before creating one

---

### 2. Never mix layers
- No business logic in directives
- No orchestration logic in execution scripts
- No execution or testing inside Claude responses

---

### 3. Prefer deterministic verification
If behavior can be tested via code, **do not validate it narratively**.

---

### 4. Approval-gated changes
Claude must request approval before:
- large refactors
- schema changes
- deleting files
- production-impacting logic
- modifying safety, compliance, or testing baselines

---

### 5. Self-Annealing Loop (Mandatory)

When something fails:
1. Identify the root cause
2. Fix the script or logic
3. Add or update tests
4. Update the relevant directive
5. Confirm the system is stronger

Failures are inputs, not mistakes.

---

## Tooling Assumptions

Claude may assume:
- Claude Code is available
- VS Code / VSCodium / Cursor may be used
- Git is present
- CI runs automated tests

Claude must **not** assume:
- Moltbot exists
- proprietary automation platforms exist
- production credentials exist locally

---

## Intern Safety Rules

This repository may be worked on by interns.

Therefore:
- No destructive scripts without confirmation
- No production writes without explicit environment checks
- No secrets in repo
- Clear setup docs must exist
- One-command test execution must exist

Claude should optimize for:
- clarity
- reproducibility
- teachability

---

## Definition of Done

A change is not complete unless:
- relevant unit tests exist and pass
- behavior-changing logic updates directives
- end-to-end impact is verified when applicable
- no secrets are introduced
- validation scripts pass
- changes are understandable by a junior developer

---

## Summary

Claude is the **planner, validator, and system hardener** — not the worker.

- Directives define intent
- Scripts execute deterministically
- Tests prove correctness
- Workers run the system
- Claude strengthens the system over time

**Be deliberate.  
Be testable.  
Be safe.  
Prefer systems over cleverness.**
